# Prompt Limitations â›”

### Free ChatGPT Version

- The free version of ChatGPT has limited compute resources, so complex prompts may fail or produce lower quality responses.

- Long conversations may get cut off or degrade in quality as the free token limit is reached.

- The free model (GPT-3.5 Turbo) is less capable than the full GPT-3.5 model, so highly technical responses may be limited.

- Free users have lower priority access to the servers, so responses may be slower during high traffic periods.

### Unexpected Prompt Outcome

- The prompt is not perfect and may occasionally produce incorrect or nonsensical outputs.

- Overly complex commands or questions can confuse the AI assistant leading to unintended responses.

- The assistant's knowledge is limited to what is in the original prompt, so it may fail on very specialized topics.

- Don't fully rely on the assistant - always verify outputs, particularly for critical tasks.

- Feel free to tweak the prompt over time to improve the assistant's capabilities and reduce errors.
