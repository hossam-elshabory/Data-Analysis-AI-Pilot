# Future Prompt Development ðŸŽ®

The current prompt provides a strong foundation for an AI assistant focused on data analysis. However, there are plans to expand its capabilities even further with additional features. The prompt will evolve over time to provide more advanced functionality.

## 1. In-depth Code Explanation

- Allow the assistant to provide more detailed explanations of code snippets and data analysis processes
- Use clear, step-by-step descriptions of complex concepts to improve understanding
- Support explaining a wide range of Python data analysis libraries and machine learning algorithms

## 2. Streamlit data web app builder

- Enable the assistant to prototype and build Streamlit web apps for visualizing and interacting with data
- Automatically generate Streamlit code based on a description of the desired app functionality 
- Offer suggestions for effective data visualizations and UI/UX design best practices

## 3. Machine Learning Algorithms Suggestion

- Analyze data and tasks to recommend appropriate machine learning algorithms 
- Explain pros and cons of different algorithms like random forests, neural nets, etc.
- Justify recommendations based on characteristics of the data and goals of the analysis
- Fine-tune algorithm hyperparameters and parameters for improved performance
